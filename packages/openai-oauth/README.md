Turn your ChatGPT account into an OpenAI-compatible local API.

```bash
> npx openai-oauth

OpenAI-compatible endpoint ready at http://127.0.0.1:10531/v1
Use this as your OpenAI base URL. No API key is required.
Available Models: gpt-5.6-sol, gpt-5.6-terra, gpt-image-2, ...

[d] Run in background  [q] Quit
```

Press `d` to keep it running in the background or `q` to quit. You can also manage it directly:

```bash
npx openai-oauth --detach
npx openai-oauth status
npx openai-oauth logs --follow
npx openai-oauth stop
```

To add Claude models from your own Claude Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise subscription, first sign in with the Claude CLI, then opt in:

```bash
npx openai-oauth login --claude
npx openai-oauth --claude
```

This adds `claude-sonnet`, `claude-opus`, and `claude-haiku` to `/v1/models`. They are text-only `/v1/chat/completions` models; tool calls are not supported. Claude mode excludes API-key and cloud-provider credentials, and it may only bind to loopback.

## Package Notes

`openai-oauth` exposes an OpenAI-compatible local endpoint backed by your ChatGPT account.

Supported endpoints:

- `/v1/responses`
- `/v1/chat/completions`
- `/v1/images/generations`
- `/v1/images/edits`
- `/v1/models`

Image generation uses JSON requests. Image editing uses the standard OpenAI multipart request with one or more `image` fields. Both return base64 image data and usage metadata.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:10531/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-image-2","prompt":"A tiny house in a forest","quality":"low"}'
```

Common flags:

| Config | Flag | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host binding | `--host` | `127.0.0.1` |
| Port | `--port` | `10531` |
| Model allowlist | `--models` | Account-specific Codex models discovered from ChatGPT |
| Claude subscription | `--claude` | Disabled |
| Auth file path | `--oauth-file` | `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json` or `~/.codex/auth.json` |
| Open browser | `--open` / `--no-open` | `--open` |
| Login timeout | `--login-timeout-ms` | `300000` |

Binding `--host` beyond loopback exposes the proxy to your network. Anyone who can reach that port can make requests with your ChatGPT account.

Claude subscription support is restricted to ordinary individual Agent SDK use. Do not host it or route another person's Claude credentials. See Anthropic's [legal and compliance guidance](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/legal-and-compliance).

Login listens on loopback and uses `http://localhost:1455/auth/callback`, the local callback URL accepted by OpenAI OAuth.

The CLI resolves the latest published Codex client version automatically. Advanced flags also exist for overriding it, the upstream Codex base URL, OAuth client id, and OAuth token URL.
